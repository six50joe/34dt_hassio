Update to the life360 package has been released. As an interim fix (i.e., before a HA release that updates to it), if you are using a container install, and you know how to get to a command line, you can do:

cd /usr/src/homeassistant/homeassistant/components/life360/
Sed -i "s/6.0.0/6.0.1/" manifest.json
Then restart HA.
