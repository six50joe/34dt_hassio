** Inclusion
With your Controller in Discovery or Add Mode, press either button on the WA00Z-1. The green LED should flash twice.
2. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was added” to the network.
3. The device will appear in the list of Switches. It should display as a switch.
✓ NOTE: If the Controller/Gateway shows the addition failed or the WA00Z-1
LED flashed red, repeat Steps 1-3.
✓ NOTE: If you have trouble adding the WA00Z-1 to a group it may be that the Home ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT” to remove it from the network. Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions as a repeater (only). “RESET UNIT” removes it completely from the network.
** Exclusion
The WA00Z-1 can be removed from the network by the Controller/Gateway. Refer to the Controller operating instructions for details.
1. Set the Controller into Removal Mode and follow its instruction to delete the WA00Z-1 from the Controller.
2. Remove the switch by pressing either button on the WA00Z-1. The LED will flash twice indicating that it has been removed.
3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device was removed” from the network.

1. Prepare the Controller to include a unit to the network by adding
   it to a group (method of adding a node to the network). Refer to
   controller instructions.
2. The NWD500Z must be in its permanently installed location. Tap
   either the top or bottom of the NWD500Z switch once.
3. You should see an indication on your Controller that the “device
   was included” in the network.

✓ ✓ NOTE: If you have trouble adding the NWD500Z to a group it may be that the Home
ID and Node ID were not cleared from it after testing. You must first “RESET UNIT”
with your controller to remove it from the network.”
Although adding it to a group includes it in the network, removing it from a group does not
remove it from the network. If removed from a group, it functions only as a repeater.

entity_id: switch.driveway_floodlight_sensor
device: 'Driveway Floodlight Sensor'
** TODO HA References
** Inclusion
The unit supports Auto Inclusion feature where it will automatically
enter Inclusionmode when first powered up after a factory
reset.

1. Turn off power to the floodlight by turning off the wall switch.
2. Try to relocate the Z-Wave controller nearer to the floodlight,
   with at most onewall separation between them.
3. Put the Z-Wave Controller into Inclusion mode.
4. Turn on the wall switch of the floodlight. The floodlight will then
   turn on for 5seconds and the Link LED will start to blink
   slowly.
5. When the Link LED stops blinking, the inclusion process is
   complete.Note: If you are connecting this unit to a Z-Wave
   controller that utilizes the 1S2security protocol, you may be asked
   by your controller to enter a 5-digitDevice Specific Key (DSK) that
   is unique to each unit. This can be found inone of two places:- on
   the QR code label on the back of the unit- on the insert card
   inside the packaging.
6. Turn on the floodlight using the Z-Wave controller to check if the
   autoinclusion is working properly. If Auto Inclusion fails, refer
   to the Troubleshooting section regarding ManualInclusion

1. Put Controller in to inclusion mode
2. Press the link button 3 times within 1.5 seconds to put unit into
   inclusion mode

* DONE Thermostats
[[http://www.gocontrol.com/manuals/GC-TBZ48-Install.pdf][GC-TBZ48 Manual]]
** Inclusion / Exclusion
General Programming Procedure (for controllers suppor􏰁ng the thermostat device class):
1. Set your primary controller to Include, add or Install mode, to add
   the thermostat as a node on your network (see your controller’s
   user manual for detailed instruc􏰁ons).
2. Press any bu􏰀on to take thermostat out of sleep mode.
3. Press and hold FAN bu􏰀on for 5 seconds. SETUP will be displayed in
   the status display line.
4. Scroll to “Z-Wave” using vw bu􏰀ons. Press SELECT.
5. When prompted by your Z-Wave controller, Press the YES bu􏰀on in the
   Z-Wave Install screen.
p6. Press SELECT (mode bu􏰀on) to add thermostat to network.
7. Display line should flash WAIT then SUCCESS if Z-Wave connec􏰁on is
   made.
8. If Z-Wave does not connect to controller, WAIT, then FAIL will
   flash in status display line.
9. If thermostat fails to connect, repeat Steps three (3) thru (7) to
   re-try connec􏰁ng.
Your controller will indicate the thermostat was successfully added to
its network (see your controller’s user manual for details). Also, you
can check if the thermostat was successfully added to the network by
checking the ZHID (Home ID) and ZNID (Node ID) located in the
Thermostat Info screen.  For other specific tasks such as adding the
thermostat to Scenes or Groups, or dele􏰁ng the thermostat from an
exis􏰁ng network, refer to the Z-Wave controller instruc􏰁ons.
Inclusion and Exclusion Inclusion or exclusion is started by pu􏰂ng the
controller into add node or remove node state and performing the
General Programming Procedure outlined above. As part of the process,
the thermostat sends a node informa􏰁on frame at normal power. Low
power inclusion or low power exclusion is not possible.  CAUTION: Do
not install ba􏰀eries and temporarily power the thermostat from 24VAC
to include onto a Z-Wave network. Shortened ba􏰀ery life may occur when
24VAC power is removed.

1. Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.
2. Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by inserting the
   battery. When the inclusion process is complete the red LED will
   turn on for approximately 10 seconds and then it will go out. If
   the LED continues to flash, repeat the inclusion process.
3. Test the garage door sensor before mounting it. Hold the sensor in
   your hand. Flip the sensor upside-down and watch the LED while
   doing so. The LED will flash each time the position of the sensor
   is changed. If your Z-Wave network has a software interface you may
   verify that the messages from the sensor are being received each
   time the sensor is flipped.
